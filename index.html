                                      <p>There are significant amount of differences between an addicted and non-addicted person on their social and familial behavior. In this paper we tried to find out the characteristics of a person related to his 
                                        social and familial life and also health issues that can prove his vulnerability to drug addiction. The research was held on the context of the people of Dhaka, Bangladesh and on an age group of 15 to 40 years.
                                         We have collected and analyzed data associated with addicted and non-addicted people from different areas of Dhaka. For addicted person's data we reached some rehabilitation center of Dhaka and for non-addicted
                                          person's data we communicated different aged group people of different colleges and universities. A machine learning approach then helped us to find out some features that differentiate between these two groups of people. 
                                          This will help people to understand if a person is going to be
                                         addicted or not based on their health issues and social and familial behavior. Our questionnaire was constructed on the basis of Addiction Severity Index with the help of psychologists and specialists on drug addiction.</p>

                                      <p>Due to the recent development in the deep learning community and the availability of state-of-the-art models, medical practitioners are getting more interested
                                         in computer vision and deep learning for diagnosis tasks. Moreover, those medical diagnostic models can also increase the reliability of conventional findings. 
                                         As radiology images can convey a lot of information for a patient’s diagnosis task, the problem is that such medical data may contain sensitive private information 
                                         in their content header. De-anonymization (i.e., removal of sensitive header information) does not work well due to the re-identification risk, which may link those 
                                         images to essential details (e.g., birth date, SSN, institution name, etc.), and such an approach can also reduce utility. In the medical domain, utility is significant 
                                         because a less accurate diagnosis may lead to the wrong course of treatment and/or loss of life. In this paper, we developed a differentially private approach that 
                                         can generate high-quality and high dimensional synthetic medical image data with guaranteed differential privacy. It can be used to create sufficient quality data to
                                          train a deep model. Moreover, we used W-GAN for bounded gradient guarantee, which eliminates the need for an extensive clipping hyperparameter search. We also added 
                                          noise selectively to the generator to maintain the privacy-utility trade-off. Due to a noise-free discriminator and such selective noise addition to the generator, high-quality and 
                                          reliable generated radiology images can be utilized for diagnosis tasks. Moreover, our approach can work in a distributed system where different hospitals can contain their private images in
                                         the local server and use a central server to generate synthetic radiology images without storing patient data.</p>

                                      <p>Movie recommender systems have become an integral part of our lives, assisting in filtering movies depending on user preferences. 
                                        The accuracy of such an adaptive system dramatically depends on user satisfaction. Users, however, face difficulty personalizing such movie recommender 
                                        systems because the decision mechanism of this type of black box system is not interpretable. As a result, it leads to a lack of user satisfaction and trust. 
                                        Besides, previous research has suggested that if users can provide input to change the recommendation mechanism based on their preferences, and if decision-making 
                                        is more transparent, such a system becomes more acceptable and appealing to users.So, we proposed and evaluated an interactive, controllable, and explainable movie 
                                        recommendation system that allows users to select from three algorithmic backbones: review-based, content-based, and collaborative recommendation approaches.An initial 
                                        survey was used to determine these pre-defined algorithms. Here, we focused on giving algorith-mic control for the user as well as an explanation for the choice to make
                                         the suggestion process transparent. Then, we investigated the effects of controllability and explainability on user trust and satisfaction. Moreover, we attempted to
                                          determine which recommendation algorithm is more acceptable to end-users and explore why a specific recommender type (Review based) gained the highest satisfaction 
                                        and popularity among others. We believe that these insights can point future designers on the right path for creating efficient recommendation systems.</p>

                                      <strong>Thesis Pre-print</strong>
                                      <p>Addiction has become a major problem world wide, and the main problem behind its addictive nature is that the person cannot identify 
                                        how gradually he is becoming more dependent on narcotics / other substances. One solution to this problem is that identify a person that
                                         he/she is prone to addiction before getting in the chronic stage so that he can be brought under proper treatment procedure. In this era of 
                                         machine learning, utilizing predictive models can help us identify key traits that lead to addiction using feature importance and can come up 
                                         with models that can identify whether a person is getting addicted or not. Coming up with such a solution will require a data set with enriched
                                          features because recent machine learning approaches are data-driven, and we tried to come up with a novel dataset that contains - social, legal,
                                           marital issues etc. So, early reconnaissance of substance use disorder may help to take primordial measures for its remedy.
                                        
                                        There are many inequalities between an addicted and a non-addicted person in terms of their social and family conduct. In this study, 
                                        the writers have tried to figure out a person's traits that are connected to his or her social and family life as well as health problems that 
                                        may show his or her exposure to drug abuse. This research was carried out on the scope of the citizens of Bangladesh and an age group limited to 
                                         15 to $40$ years. A primary data set was constructed following some international scales (WHO,ASI, etc.) which include 498 samples.For drug-addicted 
                                         person's information, some rehabilitation centers of Dhaka have considered this. For non-addicted persons data, they also communicated with people of 
                                         different ages from various colleges and universities. 498 samples were collected where one sample consisted of 60 features were trained and tested by 
                                         a supervised machine learning approach. The reliability of the data set was validated by Cronbachs Alpha Nominal Test. 5 algorithms were incorporated,
                                          including Neural Network, Deep Belief Network, Random Forest, XG-Booster, etc. and their results were compared. Among the algorithms, XGB came up with the 
                                          highest accuracy of 95.20\%, and Logistic Regression delivered the least, which is approximately 88\%. To select important features mRMR, Chi-square, and 
                                          Principle Component Analysis techniques were used. Another approach of embedded voting was incorporated to identify key features using Gradient Booster, 
                                          Support Vector Regression and Random Forest algorithm and Pearson's correlation. From feature selection, the key features of an addicted persons behavior
                                           that were influential for their drug abuse have been identified. This research will help people understand whether or not a person will be vulnerable to 
                                           addiction based on their health conditions and social and family activity.

                                      <p>Automated trading is used in most of the major markets of our world. In order to ensure sustainable development, incorporating ethical and socially responsible 
                                        ideas while designing these Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has become a necessity. Both the industry and the academia are working towards Responsible AI, which 
                                        can make Socially Responsible Investments (SRI). This paper reviews the research on SRI investment in the financial sector and evaluates these methods, which can help 
                                        find future research directions in Computational Finance.
                                        This survey looks at the machine learning techniques used for ethical decision-making while stock or forex trading, which will benefit any further research work on Responsible AI in Finance
